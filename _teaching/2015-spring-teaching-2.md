[Description of course; TODO -- the stuff below is way too pretentious, fix]

Motivation
======

After completing my first few grad-level math courses at Berkeley, I began to see (what I believed to be) a fundamental problem in the role of category theory in mathematics pedagogy. Most undergraduate courses are very careful to avoid getting into the gritty details of category theory, at most name-dropping the term "functor" or describing a particular transformation as "natural" in a handwavy, informal context. On the other hand, many of my graduate classes tacitly assumed its students were already comfortable with the language of categories. It felt like a bridge was missing between these states [TODO]

Legacy
======

It is my understanding that this course is still being taught at UC Berkeley, by my grand-alumni (alumni of my alumni, to whom I initially passed the torch). I am genuinely thrilled that this class has survived my graduation, and hope that other institutions begin offering similar courses in the future. While it would be fantastic to see the university officially incorporate the course into their mathematics curriculum, part of me believes that it is better left in the hands of the students. The subject is one which I believe thrives on a more seminar-style form of classroom participation, and I wouldn't want the class to lose the socratic liveliness that felt so important to its success when I first taught it.

Syllabus
