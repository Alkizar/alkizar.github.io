After taking the class myself in Fall 2019, I joined the course staff for <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~musa/">MUSA</a>'s student-run introduction to proof-writing. The course is intended for lower division students seeking to gain experience writing formal proofs to ease their transition into more advanced mathematical coursework. In addition to giving lectures for the class, I also rewrote a handful of chapters of the <a href="https://musa-berk.github.io/MUSA-74/notes.pdf">course notes</a>. I also assisted in teaching the course in Spring 2020, which is how I first became involved in MUSA at Berkeley.
