My undergraduate thesis and [University of Chicago REU (2022)](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2022/) project, wherein I establish a general categorical framework for transforming graded monoidal products into classical "internal" monoidal products. This makes the analogy between [Day convolution](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Day+convolution) and the [smash product](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symmetric+smash+product+of+spectra) of [S-modules](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/S-module) formal, as they are both manifestations of "internalized" graded monoidal products, and allows certain properties of these products to be derived purely syntactically.
